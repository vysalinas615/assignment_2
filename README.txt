NOTES FOR TA/GRADER:

I managed to add the cities and their attractions into a hashtable. From what I could tell it seems like every city is correctly paired with its attraction. The attractions were the keys, and the cities were the values. I also added the roads to a 2D array so that it is easier to access the values. I was having trouble figuring out how to connect the hashtable and dijkstra's algorithm/ making sure that when trying to find the shortest path, the algorithm will check to see if the attractions have all benn visted. So far my program can fully and store the information from both of the csv files properly. 

My program was supposed to take in two strings from the user in the source vertex and target vertex variables, but I didn't get far enough to implement that properly. (If I do manage to figure that out by tomorrow, please just enter the name of a city like this "San Francisco CA ". It was also supposed to take in an array of strings (using the variable attractionsList) for the attractions that the user wants to visit, but I got stuck and did not manage to fully implement this either.
